### Story
The idea came when i first got my raspberry pi, ya i was waiting for a new latest shiny version of Raspberry pi to hit the streets, and as soon as it was out, i got it. So to start with i wanted to try something not as complicated as building home automation system, one of the book raspberry pi projects has this interesting thing about making a python thing which can interact with the pi, you know just the normal stuff about checking the disk size and rebooting using whatsapp.

So i started on it, using the yowssup library, which was sort of a connector between python and whatsapp, to get blocked by whatsapp the next day, citing unauthorized application. Ok so that was ruled out, viber and skype were thought of next, but skype4me wasn`t as powerful as i wanted it to be. Facebook messenger and Telegram were the next options, I was completely hooked on Telegram, it was perfect, simplistic as whatsapp and yet so powerful, with all the options of creating bots and apis and stuff. Messenger ya i installed, had a look for 60 seconds and uninstalled.

When i further started integrating telegram + python + raspberry, i thought why not make it more entertaining, by throwing some aiml stuff too. This is how everything came into picture.
